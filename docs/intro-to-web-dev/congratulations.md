# Intro to Web development

This sections is intended for participant in my workshop I am having at [SmartNinja](https://www.smartninja.org/), where I
teach Intro to Web development 1 and Web development 2.

The guides cover general topics in web development and assume a certain programing stack and familiarities with 
the [Python](https://www.python.org) programing language. But please feel free to read them without this

Last but not least, a special thank to SmartNinja for giving me the opportunity to teach the workshop
